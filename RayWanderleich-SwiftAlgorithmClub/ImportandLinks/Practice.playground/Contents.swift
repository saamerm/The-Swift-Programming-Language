// What are algorithms and data structures?
// An algorithm is a recipe for making the computer do something.
// Data structures are the containers that hold the data while the algorithm works on it

// Why learn algorithms and data structures?
// Learning gives you ideas for improvements you can make to your own code.
// Data structures - Knowing more than just the standard gives you a bigger collection of tools you can use to build your own apps.
// Algorithms - Difference between O(n) and O(n^2) makes application faster,
// Understand how different algorithms approach different problems
// And techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms.

// Big-O notation
// Gives you a rough indication of the running time of an algorithm and the amount of memory it uses.
// Eg: "Algorithm has worst-case running time of O(n^2) and uses O(n) space," mean it's slow but doesn't need much memory(space).
